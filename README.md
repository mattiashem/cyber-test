üíª Online Network & Server Test ‚Äì Instructions & Motivation
You are about to take an online test designed to assess your knowledge in networking and server systems. This test is structured to challenge your skills and identify top performers. Don‚Äôt worry if you can't finish all the questions‚Äîthat‚Äôs intentional. The goal is to see how far you can go and how well you solve problems under pressure.

‚è∞ Be Prepared
The test will be timed, so it's important that you come fully prepared:

Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

Choose a quiet, distraction-free environment.

Minimize any external factors that might affect your device or network during the test.

üß∞ Tools & Approach
To complete the test, you‚Äôll need to run various tools and commands:

You can use your local laptop, or

You may be provided with online services to help extract and analyze data.

Many of the questions will involve digging into information‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to analyze outputs and identify the correct answers based on real data. This is a practical test of your skills, not just theory.

üöÄ Final Thoughts
Approach this test as a learning opportunity and a chance to shine. Stay calm, focus on what you know, and use your time wisely. You're capable of more than you think.

Good luck‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this! üí™



## Test Structure

### 1. DNS
In this section, students will demonstrate their understanding of DNS concepts, including:
- The structure and purpose of DNS.
- How to query DNS servers using various tools (e.g., `dig`, `nslookup`).
- How to read and interpret DNS query responses.
- Understanding different DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, etc.).
- Identifying potential issues or anomalies in DNS responses.

**Skills Tested:**
- Ability to perform manual DNS lookups.
- Analyzing DNS records to determine service configurations.
- Diagnosing DNS-related problems.

### 2. Network and Server Basics
This section focuses on foundational knowledge of networking and server interactions, including:
- How to connect to servers using basic networking tools (e.g., `telnet`, `netcat`, `openssl`).
- How to test and identify TLS versions and cipher suites supported by a server.
- Detecting and understanding open ports and services.
- Basic troubleshooting of network connectivity and security configurations.

**Skills Tested:**
- Performing manual server connections.
- Analyzing and interpreting TLS/SSL handshakes.
- Using tools to identify open ports and vulnerabilities.
- Basic interpretation of network security posture.

### 3. Understanding and Reasoning
In this part, students must demonstrate higher-level thinking by:
- Explaining how data flows across a network to deliver a working service, such as accessing a website via a web browser.
- Illustrating how different network components (DNS, TCP/IP, HTTPS, servers) interconnect to create a complete service.
- Describing the difference between a *service* (e.g., a web server) and the *protocols* or *mechanisms* that make the service possible (e.g., HTTP, TCP).

**Skills Tested:**
- Articulating technical concepts clearly in both written and video formats.
- Showing a complete understanding of end-to-end service functionality.
- Identifying key elements that contribute to a functioning network service.

## Prerequisite Knowledge Required

Before attempting the test, students should be familiar with:
- Basic networking concepts (IP addresses, ports, protocols, firewalls).
- Common networking tools (`ping`, `traceroute`, `telnet`, `netcat`, `openssl`).
- Understanding of the Domain Name System (DNS) and its role in networking.
- Basic concepts of TLS/SSL encryption and how secure communications work.
- How a basic web service operates, from DNS lookup to page rendering.
- Terminology such as "client", "server", "service", "protocol", and "port".
