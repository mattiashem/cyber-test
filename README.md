# Cyber-Test Overview

This test is designed to assess basic knowledge in networking and DNS (Domain Name System). It is divided into three distinct sections, each focusing on a critical area of cybersecurity and networking fundamentals.

## Test Structure

### 1. DNS
In this section, students will demonstrate their understanding of DNS concepts, including:
- The structure and purpose of DNS.
- How to query DNS servers using various tools (e.g., `dig`, `nslookup`).
- How to read and interpret DNS query responses.
- Understanding different DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, etc.).
- Identifying potential issues or anomalies in DNS responses.

**Skills Tested:**
- Ability to perform manual DNS lookups.
- Analyzing DNS records to determine service configurations.
- Diagnosing DNS-related problems.

### 2. Network and Server Basics
This section focuses on foundational knowledge of networking and server interactions, including:
- How to connect to servers using basic networking tools (e.g., `telnet`, `netcat`, `openssl`).
- How to test and identify TLS versions and cipher suites supported by a server.
- Detecting and understanding open ports and services.
- Basic troubleshooting of network connectivity and security configurations.

**Skills Tested:**
- Performing manual server connections.
- Analyzing and interpreting TLS/SSL handshakes.
- Using tools to identify open ports and vulnerabilities.
- Basic interpretation of network security posture.

### 3. Understanding and Reasoning
In this part, students must demonstrate higher-level thinking by:
- Explaining how data flows across a network to deliver a working service, such as accessing a website via a web browser.
- Illustrating how different network components (DNS, TCP/IP, HTTPS, servers) interconnect to create a complete service.
- Describing the difference between a *service* (e.g., a web server) and the *protocols* or *mechanisms* that make the service possible (e.g., HTTP, TCP).

**Skills Tested:**
- Articulating technical concepts clearly in both written and video formats.
- Showing a complete understanding of end-to-end service functionality.
- Identifying key elements that contribute to a functioning network service.

## What Students Can Learn From This Test

By completing this test, students will:
- Gain practical experience in querying and troubleshooting DNS services.
- Learn to connect to servers manually and interpret the results critically.
- Understand how encryption and security configurations affect server communications.
- Develop the ability to reason through how network services are constructed and operated.
- Improve their ability to communicate technical knowledge effectively through explanation and demonstration.

## Prerequisite Knowledge Required

Before attempting the test, students should be familiar with:
- Basic networking concepts (IP addresses, ports, protocols, firewalls).
- Common networking tools (`ping`, `traceroute`, `telnet`, `netcat`, `openssl`).
- Understanding of the Domain Name System (DNS) and its role in networking.
- Basic concepts of TLS/SSL encryption and how secure communications work.
- How a basic web service operates, from DNS lookup to page rendering.
- Terminology such as "client", "server", "service", "protocol", and "port".
